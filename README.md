# game-engine
This is more or less the "final form" of a long running project I started in highschool as a starting point for the games I used to write (see dberliner/tank_battle). Unfortunately I didn't archive anything back then so most older iterations are lost to time.

This code has not been actively developed in almost ten years and is not something I would consider good.
